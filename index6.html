<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>

<p>If I could visit anywhere in the world it would be Japan. I have been interested in Japanese culture since for a
    while.
    It started when I was a kid watching the anime Dragon Ball Z and it grew from there. It's not only anime that gave
    me an interest in Japan but the
    food as well. Although sushi is a popular choice of Japanese Cuisine there are many other things such as ramen,
    curry, or tonkatus (Fried breaded
    pork).</p>

<h2>A person I admire</h2>

<p>A person I admire is my dad. My family moved here from Peru over 20 years ago. Ever since then family moved here my
    dad has tried his hardest
    to stay on top. He's worked multiple jobs, sometimes works 7 days a week, and gets up at 4 in the morning to start
    his day every single day.</p>
