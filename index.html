<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<h2>A place  I would like to visit</h2>

<p>If I could visit anywhere in the world it would be Japan. I have been interested in Japanese culture since for a while.
It started when I was a kid watching the anime Dragon Ball Z and it grew from there. It's not only anime that gave me an interest in Japan but the
food as well. Although sushi is a popular choice of Japanese Cuisine there are many other things such as ramen, curry, or tonkatus (Fried breaded
pork).</p>

<h2>A person I admire</h2>

<p>A person I admire is my dad. My family moved here from Peru over 20 years ago. Ever since then family moved here my dad has tried his hardest
to stay on top. He's worked multiple jobs, sometimes works 7 days a week, and gets up at 4 in the morning to start his day every single day.</p>
